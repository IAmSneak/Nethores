# Nethores
Add ores to the nether

Coal- Due to the lack of carbon in the nether, there is very little coal. Spawns in a vein size of 4 between y=0 and y=120. Drops itself and requires a stone pickaxe.
Diamond- Again due to the lack of carbon diamond is very rare. Spawns in a vein size of 3 between y=0 and y=31. Drops itself and requires a netherite pickaxe (overworld mining is still important).
Emerald- Spawns in a vein size of 3 between y=0 and y=120. Drops emeralds and requires an iron pickaxe.
Iron- Like red sand, netherrack has lots of iron oxide in it. This means iron spawns very frequently. Spawns in a vein size of 12 between y=100 and y=126. Drops 1-4 iron ingots and requires an iron pickaxe.
Redstone- Spawns frequently but can be easy to miss. Spawns in a vein size of 16 between y=10 and y=72. Drops 1-3 redstone dust and requires a stone pickaxe.
Lapis- Spawns rarely between y=0 and y=16 in a vein size of 3. Drops itself and requires no tool.
